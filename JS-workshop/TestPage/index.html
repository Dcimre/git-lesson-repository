        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <pre>El Rustico

            The project El Rustico is a love-child of 4 good friends, 
            We are two chefs, an artist, and a yoga-instructor / photographer.
            
            Our main goal is to create healthy, affordable dishes
            which are satisfying both for your taste and your eyes as well.
            
            We trying to create a unique menu with different main course every day, cooking dishes with love and profession. 
            We use our best recipes from around the globe what we collected in the past many years.
            
            We have dishes from the mediterranean Europe and Asia, desserts from Latin America, Chai from India,
            bio slurps from eastern Europe. We always try to give a little twist even to our simplest dishes we cook,
            but also respect and keep the authentic flavours.
            
            The two chefs behind this project have more than 10 years of experience in various kitchens and positions 
            from the simplest cook to the head chef position, from the oriental to the exotic cuisine, from street food to
            the fine dining gastronomy. We also have years of experience running a kitchen in festival environment.
            
            Our dishes are Vegan, gluten and lactose free, but we keep an option for those, who wants to eat meat.
            We precisely taking care to prepare the meat completely separated from any other food we making, we cook
            it in different equipment in the other side of the kitchen.
            
            We collect our trash separated, the compost as well, and all of our cups, plates and cutlery are fully degradable and can be composted.
            
            We working with the best ingredients we can find, we use cocoa from Panama, authentic paprika from Hungary,
            chili from the Canaries, 100% home made bio drinks. We cook and prepare everything ourselves from the dishes to the drinks and sauces.
            
            We also keep our menu seasonal, and use fresh material from around.</pre>
